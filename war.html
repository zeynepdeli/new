            <h5>WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU?</h5>
            <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
            <p>The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born. The Spring 
            and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu 
            was born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn period and
            that he was active as a general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC,
            beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War 
            was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant 
            war among seven ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who fought to control the vast expanse
             of fertile territory in <span>Eastern China.</span></p>

                Sun Tzu says that it is better not to fight than to be involved in a
                conflict, but if you are going to have to fight, then you have to do
                it to win
